            "content": "Computer science is the study of computers and computational systems that involve data representation and process automation. Owing to their historical roots as calculators, computers can easily represent numerical data. Calculators rely on algorithms to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers. But what about more complex data? How do computers represent complex objects like graphs, images, videos, or sentences? What complications arise when we represent or process data in certain ways? These are some of the foundational questions that computer scientists and programmers focus on when designing software and applications that we use to solve problems.\n\nA data type determines how computers process data by defining the possible values for data and the possible functionality or operations on that data. For example, the integer data type is defined as values from a certain range of positive or negative whole numbers with functionality including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The string data type is defined as a sequence of characters where each character can be a letter, digit, punctuation, or space, with functionalities that include adding or deleting a character from a string, concatenating strings, and comparing two strings based, for example, on their alphabetical order.\n\nData types like strings are an example of abstraction, the process of simplifying a concept in order to represent it in a computer. The string data type takes a complex concept like a sentence and represents it in terms of more basic data that a computer can work with. When a computer compares two strings, it is really comparing the individual numerical character codes (see Chapter 5 Hardware Realizations of Algorithms: Computer Systems Design) corresponding to each pair of characters within the two strings.\n\nIn this section, we will learn how to solve problems by choosing abstractions for complex data. We will see that just as our data grows more complex, so do our algorithms.\n\nIntroduction to Algorithms\nAn algorithm is a sequence of precise instructions that operate on data. We can think of recipes, plans, or instructions from our daily lives as examples of algorithms. Computers can only execute a finite pre-defined set of instructions exactly as instructed, which is why programming can feel like such a different way of communicating as compared to our natural human languages. A program is an implementation (realization) of an algorithm written in a formal programming language.\n\nAlthough each programming language is different from all the others, there are still common ideas across all of them. Knowing just a few of these common ideas enables computer scientists to address a wide variety of problems without having to start from scratch every single time. For example, the abstraction of string data enables programmers to write programs that operate on human-readable letters, digits, punctuation, or spaces without having to determine how to delve into each of these concepts. Programming languages allow us to define abstractions for representing ideas in a computer (see Chapter 4 Linguistic Realization of Algorithms: Low-Level Programming Languages for more).\n\nThe study of data structures and algorithms focuses on identifying what is known as a canonical algorithm: a well-known algorithm that showcases design principles helpful across a wide variety of problems. In this chapter, rather than focusing on the programming details, we will instead focus on algorithms and the ideas behind them.\n\nUnderstanding Data Structures\nFor many real-world problems, the ability to design an algorithm depends on how the data is represented. A data structure is a complex data type with two equally important parts:\n\na specific representation or way of organizing a collection of more than one element, which is an individual value or data point, and\na specific functionality or operations such as adding, retrieving, and removing elements.\nIn our previous example, a string is a data structure for representing sentences as a sequence of characters. It has specific functionality such as character insertion or deletion, string concatenation, and string comparison.\n\nAlthough the values for complex data are often diverse, computer scientists have designed data structures so that they can be reused for other problems. For example, rather than designing a specialized data structure for sentences in every human language, we often use a single, universal string data structure to represent sentences, including characters from different languages in the same sentence. (We will later see some drawbacks of generalizing assumptions in the design of data structures and algorithms.) In addition, computers take time to execute algorithms, so computer scientists are concerned about efficiency in terms of how long an algorithm takes to compute a result.\n\nAmong the different types of universal data structures, computer scientists have found it helpful to categorize data structures according to their functionality without considering their specific representation. An abstract data type (ADT) consists of all data structures that share common functionality but differ in specific representation.\n\nCommon abstract data types for complex data follow, and list and set types are shown in Figure 3.2. We will discuss each abstract data type in more detail together with their data structure implementations.\n\nA list represents an ordered sequence of elements and allows adding, retrieving, and removing elements from any position in the list. Lists are indexed because they allow access to elements by referring to the element's index, which is the position or address for an element in the list. For example, a list can be used to represent a to-do list, where each item in the list is the next task to be completed in chronological order.\nA set represents an unordered collection of unique elements and allows adding, retrieving, and removing elements from the set. Sets typically offer less functionality than lists, but this reduction in functionality allows for more efficient data structure representations. For example, a set can be used to represent the names of all the places that you want to visit in the future.\nA map represents unordered associations between key-value pairs of elements, where each key can only appear once in the map. A map is also known as a dictionary since each term (key) has an associated definition (value). Maps are often used in combination with other data structures. For example, a map can be used to represent a travel wish list: each place that you want to visit in the future can be associated with the list of things that you want to do when you arrive at a given place.\nA priority queue represents a collection of elements where each element has an associated priority value. In addition to adding elements, priority queues focus on retrieving and removing the element with the highest priority. For example, a priority queue can be used to represent inpatient processing at a hospital emergency room: the patients with more urgent need for care may be prioritized and dealt with first.\nA graph represents binary relations among a collection of entities. More specifically, the entities are represented as vertices in the graph, and a directed or undirected edge is added between two vertices to represent the presence or absence of a certain relation. For example, a friendship graph can be used to represent the friendship relations between people, in which case an undirected edge is added between two persons if they are friends. Graphs allow operations such as adding vertices and edges, removing vertices and edges, and retrieving all edges adjacent to a given vertex.\n\nFigure 3.2 Lists and sets are common abstract data types used to represent complex data and can be in the form of integers or string data.

Computer scientists apply a top-down approach.\n\nSelect an appropriate abstract data type by analyzing the problem to determine the necessary functionality and operations.\nSelect an appropriate data structure by quantifying the resource constraints (usually program running time) for each operation.\nThe primary concern is the data and the operations to be performed on them. Thinking back to simple data types like numbers, we focused on addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division as the basic operations. Likewise, to represent complex data types, we also focus on the operations that will most directly support our algorithms. After deciding on an abstract data type, we then choose a particular data structure that implements the abstract data type.\n\nLinear Data Structures\nIf a problem can be solved with an ordered sequence of elements (e.g., numbers, payroll records, or text messages), the simplest approach might be to store them in a list. Some problems require that actions be performed in a strict chronological order, such as processing items in the order that they arrive or in the reverse order. In these situations, a linear data structure, which is a category of data structures where elements are ordered in a line, is appropriate. There are two possible implementations for the list abstract data type. The first, an array list (Figure 3.3), is a data structure that stores list elements next to each other in memory. The other is a linked list (Figure 3.4), which is a list data structure that does not necessarily store list elements next to each other, but instead works by maintaining, for each element, a link to the next element in the list. Both array lists and linked lists are linear data structures because their elements are organized in a line, one after the other. An advantage of array lists is that they allow (random) access to every element in the list in a single step. This is in sharp contrast with linked lists, which only supports \u201csequential access.\u201d On the other hand, linked lists support fast insertion and deletion operations, which array lists do not.\n\n\nFigure 3.3 An array list stores elements next to each other in memory in the exact list order. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\n\nFigure 3.4 A linked list maintains a link for each element to the next element in the list. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\nEarlier, we introduced sets as offering less functionality than lists. Both array lists and linked lists can also implement the set abstract data type. Sets differ from lists in two ways: sets are unordered\u2014so elements are not assigned specific positions\u2014and sets only consist of unique elements. In addition to implementing sets, linear data structures can also implement the map, priority queue, and graph abstract data types. If linear data structures can cover such a wide range of abstract data types, why learn other data structures? In theory, any complex data can be represented with an array list or a linked list, although it may not be optimal, as we will explain further.\n\nOne drawback of relying only on linear data structures is related to the concept of efficiency. Even if linear data structures can solve any problem, we might prefer more specialized data structures that can solve fewer problems more efficiently, and help represent real world data arrangements more closely. This is particularly useful when we have large amounts of data like places or roads in an online map of the entire world. Linear data structures ultimately organize elements in a line, which is necessary for implementing lists but not necessary for other abstract data types. Other data structures specialize in implementing sets, maps, and priority queues by organizing elements in a hierarchy rather than in a line.\n\nTree Data Structures\nA tree is a hierarchical data structure. While there are many kinds of tree data structures, all of them share the same basic organizing structure: a node represents an element in a tree or graph. A node may or may not have a descendant. A child node is a descendant of another node. Often, the primary node is referred to as the \u201cparent node.\u201d Trees maintain a hierarchy through parent-child relationships, which repeat from the root node at the top of the tree down to each leaf node, which is at the bottom of the tree and has no children. The height of a tree corresponds to the depth of the hierarchy of descendants. Figure 3.5 illustrates the structure and elements of a tree.\n\n\nFigure 3.5 A tree is a hierarchical data structure with nodes where each node can have zero or more descendant child nodes. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\nBinary Search Trees\nA binary search tree is a kind of tree data structure often used to implement sets and maps with the binary tree property, which requires that each node can have either zero, one, or two children, and the search tree property, which requires that elements in the tree are organized least-to-greatest from left-to-right. In other words, the values of all the elements of the left subtree of a node have a lesser value than that of the node. Similarly, the values of all the elements of the right subtree of a node have a greater value than that of the node. The search tree property suggests that when elements are read left-to-right in a search tree, we will get the elements in sorted order. For numbers, we can compare and sort numbers by their numeric values. For more complex data like words or sentences, we can compare and sort them in dictionary order. Binary search trees use these intrinsic properties of data to organize elements in a searchable hierarchy (Figure 3.6).\n\n\nFigure 3.6 A binary search tree organizes elements least to greatest from left to right. (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\nThe tree illustrated satisfies the binary tree property based on the natural alphabetical order between letters since the elements in the tree are organized least to greatest from left to right. In other words, for a given list of letters (A, B, C, D, E, F, G), start at the middle of the list of letters with D (the root node) then pick B as the left sub-node of D which is at the middle of the list of letters (A, B, C) that is on the right of D and pick F as the right sub-node of D, which is at the middle of the list letters (E, F, G) that is on the left of D. Finally, organize the remaining letters under sub-nodes B and F to ensure that they are least-to-greatest from the left to right.\n\nThe search tree property is responsible for efficiency improvements over linear data structures. By storing elements in a sorted order in the search tree rather than in an indexed order in a list, binary search trees can more efficiently find a given element. Consider how we might look up words in a dictionary. A binary search tree dictionary storing all the terms and their associated definitions can enable efficient search by starting at the middle of the dictionary (the root node) before determining whether to go left or right based on whether we expect our word to appear earlier or later in the dictionary order. If we repeat this process, we can repeatedly rule out half of the remaining elements each time. Searching for a term in a list-based dictionary that is not sorted, on the other hand, would require us to start from the beginning of the list and consider every word until the end of the list since there is no underlying ordering structure to the elements.\n\nBalanced Binary Search Trees\nBinary search trees are not as effective as we have described. The dictionary example represents a best-case scenario for binary search trees. We can only rule out half of the remaining elements each time if the binary search tree is perfectly balanced, which means that for every node in the binary search tree, its left and right subtrees contain the same number of elements. This is a strong requirement, since the order in which elements are added to a binary search tree determines the shape of the tree. In other words, binary search trees can easily become unbalanced. It is possible for a binary search tree to look exactly like a linked list, in which each node contains either zero children or one child, which is no more efficient than a linear data structure.\n\nAn AVL tree (named after its inventors, Adelson-Velsky and Landis) is a balanced binary search tree data structure often used to implement sets or maps with one additional tree property: the AVL tree property, which requires the left and right subtrees to be balanced at every node of the tree. AVL trees are just one among many \u201cself-balancing\u201d binary search trees. A balanced binary search tree introduces additional properties that ensure that the tree reorganizes elements to maintain balance (Figure 3.7).\n\n\nFigure 3.7 An AVL tree rotates nodes in a binary search tree to maintain balance. This sequence of steps illustrates the insertion of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 into an initially empty AVL tree. (The steps in which rotation occurs are represented by the solid black arrows.) (attribution: Copyright Rice University, OpenStax, under CC BY 4.0 license)\nBalanced binary search trees such as AVL trees represent just one approach for ensuring that the tree never enters a worst-case situation. There are many other balanced binary search tree data structures in addition to AVL trees. Balanced binary search trees can also be used to implement the priority queue abstract data type if the elements are ordered according to their priority value. But balanced search trees are not the only way to implement priority queues.\n\nBinary Heaps\nPriority queues focus on retrieving and removing the highest-priority elements first, adding an element to a priority queue also involves specifying an associated priority value that is used to determine which elements are served next. For example, patients in an emergency room might be served according to the severity of their health concerns rather than according to arrival time. A binary heap is a type of binary tree data structure that is also the most common implementation for the priority queue abstract data type (Figure 3.8). A binary heap is not a search tree, but rather a hybrid data structure between a binary tree and an array list. Data is stored as an array list in memory, but the binary heap helps visualize data in the same way that a binary tree does, which makes it easier to understand how data are stored and manipulated. Binary heaps organize elements according to the heap property, which requires that the priority value of each node in the heap is greater than or equal to the priority values of its children. The heap property suggests that the highest-priority element will always be the root node where it is efficient to access.\n\n\nFigure 3.8 A binary heap is the most common implementation of the priority queue abstract data type. The priority value of each node in the binary heap is greater than or equal to the priority values of the children. Note that the value stored in the root node of the right subtree can be smaller than the value stored in any node in the left subtree, while not violating the heap property.

How do we track natural disasters and identify the most affected areas in order to coordinate relief and support efforts? In the United States, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is responsible for reporting earthquakes using thousands of earthquake sensors. However, that still leaves many places without earthquake sensors. Outside the United States, sensor technology may be less robust or inaccessible.\n\nSocial network data can be used to enhance this information and more quickly alert governments about natural disasters in real-time. By monitoring public social network platforms for occurrences of short posts such as \u201cearthquake?,\u201d we can quickly localize earthquakes based on the user\u2019s geolocation data. However, aggregating and understanding this data\u2014often thousands of data points arriving in minutes\u2014requires efficient data structures and algorithms. We can use a binary heap that implements the priority queue abstract data type for an earthquake-tracking program. For each \u201cearthquake?\u201d post received for a given geolocation, we can increase the priority of the earthquake locations, which helps identify the likely-earthquake location that is closest to the user\u2019s real location. At any time, we can efficiently retrieve the highest-priority element from the priority queue. By choosing to use a binary heap rather than a linear data structure for implementing the priority queue, we can ensure that the earthquake-tracking program is able to keep up with the thousands of posts made every minute during an earthquake.\n\nGraph Data Structures\nBoth binary search trees and binary heap data structures represent more efficient ways to implement sets, maps, and priority queues by organizing data according to their intrinsic properties. In both cases, the properties of data enable efficient addition, retrieval, and removal of elements.\n\nGraphs are a different kind of abstract data type. Rather than focusing on addition, retrieval, and removal, graphs focus on explicitly modeling the relationships between elements. Graphs afford access not only to elements, but also to relationships between elements.\n\nA vertex represents an element in a graph or a special type of it, such as a tree.\nAn edge is the relationship between vertices or nodes. Optionally, edges can have associated weights. In a graph abstract data type, the relationships between two vertices connected by an edge are considered adjacent.\nLINK TO LEARNING\nVisualgo is a website that provides animations to help users learn more about algorithms and data structures. They have exercises to help understand several concepts presented in this chapter. You can access animations on various data structures and algorithms such as a linked list, a binary search tree, and graph structures.\n\nIn computer networks such as the Internet, graphs can represent individual network routers as nodes with data packets flowing between directly connected routers along edges. Even though not every router is directly connected to every other router, the router at the current node can analyze an incoming data packet to determine which edge it should travel through next. By repeating this process, a data packet can travel from a router on the Internet to another router on the Internet even though the two routers are not directly adjacent to each other.\n\nGraphs are unique in that they can directly represent a wide variety of real-world problems, such as the following:\n\nA social network, where each vertex is a person, and each edge is a friendship.\nThe Web, where each vertex is a webpage, and each edge is a link.\nA campus map, where each vertex is a building, and each edge is a footpath.\nA course prerequisite diagram, where each vertex is a course, and each edge is a prerequisite.\nUnlike the list, set, map, and priority queue abstract data types, which have relatively standardized functionality focusing on the addition, retrieval, and removal of elements, the graph abstract data type is much less standardized. Typically, graph algorithm designers will create their own graph data type to represent a problem. The corresponding graph problem can then be represented using or adapting a standard graph algorithm. Unlike programming with other abstract data types, much of the hard work of solving a problem with a graph occurs when programmers decide what the vertices and edges represent, and which graph algorithm would be appropriate to solve the problem. They also must consider the consequences of how they represent the problem.",
